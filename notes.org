* TODO figure out a better way to handle templates
  - maybe just use templates and have them in the current directory
    - include path in input file, can also have central template dir then
  - want to have a default, I guess put that in a templates.go file
    - coded as string literals

* TODO use taylor.py internals to write anpass and intder files

* TODO automate internal coordinate generation                         :HARD:

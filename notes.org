* TODO might need to change energy line now that energy= in input constraints
  - maybe just a space before energy

* TODO need way to specify atom ordering in transition from molpro to intder

* TODO figure out a better way to handle templates
  - moved away from go templates but now using "template" input files
  - could bundle literals with the program and use others if found in the input file

* TODO use taylor.py internals to write anpass and intder files
  - only includes bottom of intder file, top falls under the hard one below
  - could write entire anpass from scratch though

* TODO automate internal coordinate generation                         :HARD:

* TODO replace intder, anpass, and spectro entirely                    :HARD:

* DONE need way to specify atom ordering in transition from molpro to intder
  - leave intder geometry in as template for this
  - sort by all fields in xyz coords to emulate what intder expects
  - problem randomly matching atom order to coordinates
    - H O O H for example if you flip the Os or Hs

* TODO resume from each point of the process
  - pts, freqs mainly; if opt fails probably need to restart and if freq fails just run that alone

* TODO figure out a better way to handle templates
  - moved away from go templates but now using "template" input files
  - could bundle literals with the program and use others if found in the input file

* TODO use taylor.py internals to write anpass and intder files
  - only includes bottom of intder file, top falls under the hard one below
  - could write entire anpass from scratch though

* TODO automate internal coordinate generation                         :HARD:

* TODO replace intder, anpass, and spectro entirely                    :HARD:

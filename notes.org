* Summarize could probably be a separate package
  - probably the most useful to separate out into its own executable

* WAIT how/when to handle num disps? 
  - waiting on email back

* TODO report rotational and geometrical data
** TODO try using the table package I ignored before
** TODO report BZS or BZA? 
   - need to ask
** TODO which geometry data?
   - guessing r(equil) but what are the other two

* DONE Problem with sequoia freq associated with reading zmat from log file
  - it was reading the CCSD(t)-F12b energy line before the optimization finished
    - reporting job finished when it was still running
  - cannot replicate locally
  - potentially reading the log file before it's finished being written?
  - just skip freq if zmat is nil for now

* DONE need way to specify atom ordering in transition from molpro to intder
  - leave intder geometry in as template for this
  - sort by all fields in xyz coords to emulate what intder expects
  - problem randomly matching atom order to coordinates
    - H O O H for example if you flip the Os or Hs

** DONE if transform fails, try exchanging columns to fix it
   - molpro put my al2o2 in a different plane when setting one angle to 90.0
   - this broke the transform because the pattern didnt match
** WAIT also might need to be robust to slight variations in the coords
   - I think this is handled, but wait and see
   - ie not a perfect tie

* TODO resume from each point of the process
  - pts, freqs mainly; if opt fails need to restart and if freq fails just run that

* WAIT figure out a better way to handle templates
  - I think the current approach is okay - eventually shrink to only a molpro input file
    - the intder, anpass, and spectro should be generated
  - moved away from go templates but now using "template" input files
  - could bundle literals with the program and use others if found in the input file

* TODO use taylor.py internals to write anpass and intder files
  - only includes bottom of intder file, top falls under the hard one below
  - could write entire anpass from scratch though

* TODO automate internal coordinate generation                         :HARD:

* TODO replace intder, anpass, and spectro entirely                    :HARD:

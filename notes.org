* DONE need way to specify atom ordering in transition from molpro to intder
  - leave intder geometry in as template for this
  - sort by all fields in xyz coords to emulate what intder expects
  - problem randomly matching atom order to coordinates
    - H O O H for example if you flip the Os or Hs
** TODO if transform fails, try exchanging columns to fix it
   - molpro put my al2o2 in a different plane when setting one angle to 90.0
   - this broke the transform because the pattern didnt match
   - also might need to be robust to slight variations in the coords
     - ie not a perfect tie

* TODO resume from each point of the process
  - pts, freqs mainly; if opt fails probably need to restart and if freq fails just run that alone

* TODO figure out a better way to handle templates
  - moved away from go templates but now using "template" input files
  - could bundle literals with the program and use others if found in the input file

* TODO use taylor.py internals to write anpass and intder files
  - only includes bottom of intder file, top falls under the hard one below
  - could write entire anpass from scratch though

* TODO automate internal coordinate generation                         :HARD:

* TODO replace intder, anpass, and spectro entirely                    :HARD:

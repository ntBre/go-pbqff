  Running pbqff with a geometry optimization requires the input
  geometry in the pbqff input file to be in a Zmat format and for the
  template quantum chemical program input file to contain an
  optimization directive. If an optimization is requested, the
  reference energy will be taken from the optimization output and a
  harmonic frequency calculation will be submitted upon its finishing.

  # TODO harmonic frequency should probably be separate from
  # optimization, at least separable

  If an optimization is not requested, by using "flags=noopt" in the
  input file, a Cartesian geometry will be read from the pbqff input
  file and a single-point energy calculation at
